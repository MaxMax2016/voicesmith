# VoiceSmith [WIP]

VoiceSmith makes it possible to train and infer on both single and multispeaker models without any coding experience.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

#### Hardware:
* OS: Windows or any Linux based operating system.
* Graphics: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is heavily recommended, you can train on CPU otherwise but it will take days if not weeks. [Click here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) for a list of GPUs with CUDA support.
* RAM: 8GB of RAM, you can try with less but it may not work.

#### Software:
* Python >=3.7,<3.11, you can [download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Docker, you can [download it here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed, if not it will ask you on startup

### How to install

1. Download the latest installer from the [releases](https://github.com/dunky11/voicesmith/releases) page
