# VoiceSmith [WIP]

VoiceSmith makes it possible to train and infer on both single and multispeaker models without any coding experience.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* OS: Windows or any Linux based operating system.
* Graphics: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is heavily recommended, you can train on CPU otherwise but it will take days. [Click here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) for a list of GPUs with CUDA support.


Windows or 
Make sure you have Python >=3.7,<3.11 installed

2. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed, if not it will ask you on startup
